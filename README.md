I am pretty excited to be starting my coding journey. I have been working my butt off in outside sales for the past two years & have made a lucrative living. Moreover this lifestle has left me unfulfilled, unhealthy & unhappy. I hope to achieve a greater quality of life & a work environment which appreciates me!
